## Data Flow & Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User Webcam] --> B[Face Detection (face-api.js)]
    B --> C[Emotion Recognition]
    C --> D[UI Update]
    D --> E[Music Recommendation]
    E --> F[Music Player]
    C --> G[Image Capture]
    G --> H[Express.js Backend]
    H --> I[Image Storage]
```

### Data Flow Steps
1. **User Webcam**: User grants access to webcam.
2. **Face Detection**: face-api.js detects faces and landmarks.
3. **Emotion Recognition**: AI model predicts user's emotion.
4. **UI Update**: Detected emotion is displayed with emoji and text.
5. **Music Recommendation**: App fetches mood-based songs from iTunes API.
6. **Music Player**: User can play, skip, or pause recommended tracks.
7. **Image Capture**: Captures webcam image when emotion is detected.
8. **Express.js Backend**: Handles image saving and retrieval via REST API.
9. **Image Storage**: Images are stored in `public/images/` and tracked in `imageCount.json`.
